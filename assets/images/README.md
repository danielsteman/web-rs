# images

I don't like to store images in Git repos so I added the images that are used in the articles in the copied equivalent of this folder in `/target/lambda/webrs/assets/images`. This way, they'll be uploaded to S3 and made available to AWS Lambda (my choice of infrastructure for this project).
