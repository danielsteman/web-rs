## MLflow

MLflow is an end-to-end machine learning solution that helps keeping track of trained models. In a performant data science team, there is a desire the train many models, many times, with several combinations of parameters and with different features (input variables). To determine which configuration performs best, each iteration needs to be tracked carefully.
