# BundleLint

As you might have read in my previous posts, I have been using Databricks asset bundles quite extensively. If you are not familiar, these are packages consisting of Python code and `yaml` specifications to embrace the as-code philosophy. It reminds me a bit of how Kubernetes works, where each object is declared as a `yaml` block. It's super convenient to declare resources as code because it makes them reproducable and changes to resources are managed by some continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) process that involves a(n) (automated) code review (unless you push to `main`). Part of the automated review is [linting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting). In many of my projects this is already done [before a new commit is created](https://danielsteman.com/blog/10), but it is done more extensively in the CI pipeline, which needs to pass for every [merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/). In case of Databricks asset bundles, you'd use the `databricks-cli` [bundle commands](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/bundle-commands.html). For example:

```bash
databricks bundle validate
```

This validates the `yaml` specifications in a bundle and will raise warnings for unknown keys or even errors for incorrect references. Up until now, this guard rail prevented many errors in to-be-merged code, but I wanted to take a step further. As the number of bundles grow, so does the potential for shipping bugs. This led to the creation of [BundleLint](https://github.com/danielsteman/bundlelint). It is a command line tool that can perform more custom and opinionated checks. An example of such a check is making sure that Databricks workflows that are deployed to the production target (AKA production workspace) send notifications to Slack when they fail.

Like the `databricks-cli`, `bundlelint` is built using [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), a simple interface for Go that takes care of a lot of common CLI functionality so you don't have to, such as automatic help generation for commands and flags and automatically generated autocomplete for your favorite shell. What I also liked about it is that you can easily register functions that need to be executed when a CLI command is ran. The registered function takes
arguments and flags and performs a task, conditionally. `cobra` suggests that "the best applications read like sentences", so `bundlelint test_bundle` would make sense, considering "bundlelint" to be a made up verb based on an actual verb, "lint".

```bash
‚ùØ bundlelint -h
A CLI to govern your Databricks asset bundles with flexibility.

Usage:
  bundlelint [bundle_path] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for bundlelint
  -v, --version   version for bundlelint
```

Using a compiled language makes it easier to deploy the application because you don‚Äôt have to worry as much about system dependencies, such as a JVM for Java, `node_modules` for Javascript or a Python interpreter for, yes you guessed it, Python. With Go, you can [cross compile](https://golangcookbook.com/chapters/running/cross-compiling/) for all architectures and [release](https://github.com/danielsteman/bundlelint/releases/tag/v1.0.0) the pre built tool for Mac, Mac silicon, Linux etc. The binary can be compressed using [tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/), reducing the file size that was quite small to begin with, and preserving the file's permissions, which is required to make the `bundlelint` binary [executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod). `tar` also allows us to compress the same file name, `bundlelint`, multiple times and call the output differently. This is useful for cross compilation, as you can build `bundlelint` several times and create a compressed file with the architecture in its name after each time you compile. In the following snippet, I'm compiling for both ARM64 (Apple silicon) and AMD64 (Good ol' Intel üìâ).

```bash
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o bundlelint
tar -czvf bundlelint_1.0.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz bundlelint

GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bundlelint
tar -czvf bundlelint_1.0.0_darwin_amd64.tar.gz bundlelint
```

## Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that is used extensively in my team, as everyone uses macOS, despite the amazing efforts of the [asahi linux](https://asahilinux.org/) team. Hence, I decided to make my first [formula](https://github.com/danielsteman/homebrew-tap/blob/main/Formula/bundlelint.rb) available. Since the Github repository doesn't have enough stars (yet ü§°), I had to create my own [tap](https://github.com/danielsteman/homebrew-tap). The process is quite straight forward. In a Ruby file I determine which architecture a user needs (`if Hardware::CPU.arm?`) and based on that I set the URL to the ARM64 build or the AMD64 build. Next to the URL I pass a [sha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms) of the compressed build which is used to ensure that the file has not been manipulated on its way from Github to the user's machine. Using my personal tap, any macOS user can now install `bundlelint` using `brew`:

```bash
brew tap danielsteman/tap
brew install bundlelint
```

## Notes

It was fun building and shipping this CLI with Go and Homebrew, partly because it was so convenient to do so (shout out to `cobra`) and because it is always fun to build something using a different stack than your daily driver (Python). A colleague pointed out that [cue](https://cuelang.org/docs/introduction/) is also a good contender to validate Databricks asset bundles against a set of business rules, as it allows you to express rules and constraints declaratively. After some more research, I found that [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) could also be a contender. This already indicates that `bundlelint` is overengineered and performs tasks that are already performed well by renowned technology. But who cares, sometimes you just need to build something for sake of building.
