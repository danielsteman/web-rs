# Building a phone from scratch

Last weekend I was reading about this reporter who ditched his smartphone in favor of a simple, old school, Nokia like brick. It allows for calling and texting and that's it. This reporter had been using the phone for months and seemed very pleased with the results. Instead of doom scrolling on social media, he would read a book and go outside more. I noticed that I'm sometimes scrolling LinkedIn when I actually wanted to look up something on the internet and reading about the experience of this reporter sparked an idea. Obviously you can just delete the apps that distract you the most, but this "soft block" is easily lifted as you can just reinstall the app or login to social media through a browser. Why not get a device that only has the core functionalities of a modern phone, without the rest. This would be a "hard block" from things that distract you, such as social media.
