# Install Poetry lock file on Databricks infra

Most of the projects in my team rely on [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for efficient Python dependencies management. What I like about Poetry is that it maintains a [lock file](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#installing-with-poetrylock) that keeps track of the versions of dependencies of dependencies ([transistive dependencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_dependency)), which makes your build a little bit more reproducable. You can even produce a lock file as a `requirements.txt` for pip, using [the CLI](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/). This is especially useful for environments where you don't necessarily want to install Poetry, such as the runtime environment of your app.

Recently, I have been working on a data science project that [trains, tests and validates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets) a machine learning model, stores this model as a serialised artifact and loads this artifact in a [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) service, such that the model can be used by other services. If you want to know more about machine learning model services, you should read some of my [earlier work](https://danielsteman.com/blog/6).
