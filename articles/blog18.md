# Cue lang

JSON ⊆ CUE, but CUE ⊈ JSON. [CUE](https://cuelang.org/) is an open-sourced data validation language that helps you with validation, configuration and even generation of code. The CUE language allows you to be flexible in how you want to do each of those.

I was especially interested in the validation capabilities, as I deal with a lot of YAML configuration files that describe Databricks or Kubernetes resources. Having all these configurations across projects can make it challenging to enforce policies before the deployment with given configuration takes place. The [databricks-cli](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/bundle-commands) implements a command `databricks bundle validate` that parses the YAML configuration of a particular asset bundle and performs validation. This proved to be an effective mechanism to prevent deploying faulty configurations. Inspired by this, I created [bundlelint](https://danielsteman.com/blog/16) at the start of the year to do the same, but then with additional custom rules. It was a fun to build project but I quickly learned that the tool wasn't flexible enough. A DevOps colleague recognised these challenges and pointed me to CUE. The philosophy of `bundlelint` would remain, but it would leverage the powerful CUE language to let users come up with their own custom rules for Databricks asset bundle configurations. The fact that CUE integrates well with Go made it an even more appealing tool.
